Actinic keratosis (AK), sometimes called solar keratosis or senile keratosis,[1][2] is a pre-cancerous[3] area of thick, scaly, or crusty skin.[4][5] Actinic keratosis is a disorder (-osis) of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (actin-).[6] These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun.[7] They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds, usually over the course of decades. Given their pre-cancerous nature, if left untreated, they may turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.[5] Untreated lesions have up to a 20% risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma,[8] so treatment by a dermatologist is recommended. Actinic keratoses characteristically appear as thick, scaly, or crusty areas that often feel dry or rough. Size commonly ranges between 2 and 6 millimeters, but they can grow to be several centimeters in diameter. Notably, AKs are often felt before they are seen, and the texture is sometimes compared to sandpaper.[9] They may be dark, light, tan, pink, red, a combination of all these, or have the same color as the surrounding skin. Given the causal relationship between sun exposure and AK growth, they often appear on a background of sun-damaged skin and in areas that are commonly sun-exposed, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips. Because sun exposure is rarely limited to a small area, most people who have an AK have more than one.[10] If clinical examination findings are not typical of AK and the possibility of in situ or invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cannot be excluded based on clinical examination alone, a biopsy or excision can be considered for definitive diagnosis by histologic examination of the lesional tissue.[11] Multiple treatment options for AK are available. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one option the treatment of numerous AK lesions in a region of the skin, termed field cancerization.[12] It involves the application of a photosensitizer to the skin followed by illumination with a strong light source. Topical creams, such as 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod, may require daily application to affected skin areas over a typical time course of weeks.[13] Cryotherapy is frequently used for few and well-defined lesions,[14] but undesired skin lightening, or hypopigmentation, may occur at the treatment site.[15] By following up with a dermatologist, AKs can be treated before they progress to skin cancer. If cancer does develop from an AK lesion, it can be caught early with close monitoring, at a time when treatment is likely to have a high cure rate. SOURCE: WIKIPEDIA"

Like liver spots, seborrheic keratoses are seen more often as people age. The tumours (also called lesions) appear in various colours, from light tan to black. They are round or oval, feel flat or slightly elevated, like the scab from a healing wound, and range in size from very small to more than 2.5 centimetres (1 in) across.[5] They can often come in association with other skin conditions, including basal cell carcinoma.[6] Rarely seborrheic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma occur at the same location. At clinical examination the differential diagnosis includes warts[4] and melanoma. Because only the top layers of the epidermis are involved, seborrheic keratoses are often described as having a pasted on appearance. Some dermatologists refer to seborrheic keratoses as seborrheic warts, because they resemble warts, but strictly speaking the term warts refers to lesions that are caused by human papillomavirus.[7] SOURCE: WIKIPEDIA"

Dermatofibromas[4] are hard solitary slow-growing papules (rounded bumps) that may appear in a variety of colours, usually brownish to tan; they are often elevated or pedunculated. A dermatofibroma is associated with the dimple sign; by applying lateral pressure, there is a central depression of the dermatofibroma. Although typical dermatofibromas cause little or no discomfort, itching and tenderness can occur. Dermatofibromas can be found anywhere on the body, but most often they are found on the legs and arms.[5] They occur most often in women; the male to female ratio is about 1:4.[6] The age group in which they most commonly occur is 20 to 45 years. Some physicians and researchers believe dermatofibromas form as a reaction to previous injuries such as insect bites or thorn pricks.[6] They are composed of disordered collagen laid down by fibroblasts. Dermatofibromas are classed as benign skin lesions, meaning they are completely harmless, though they may be confused with a variety of subcutaneous tumours.[7] Deep penetrating dermatofibromas may be difficult to distinguish, even histologically, from rare malignant fibrohistocytic tumours like dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.[8] Dermatofibromas typically have a positive buttonhole sign, or central dimpling in the center.[9] SOURCE: WIKIPEDIA"

The high concentration of the body's pigmenting agent, melanin, is responsible for their dark color. Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi and can occur in all mammalian species, but have been documented most extensively in humans, dogs, and horses.[5] SOURCE: WIKIPEDIA"

Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), also known as epidermoid carcinomas, comprise a number of different types of cancer that result from squamous cells.[1] These cells form on the surface of the skin, on the lining of hollow organs in the body, and on the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts.[1] Medical history, physical examination and medical imaging may suggest a squamous cell carcinoma, but a biopsy for histopathology generally establishes the diagnosis. TP63 staining is the main histological marker for Squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, TP63 is an essential transcription factor to establish squamous cell identity.[9] Squamous Cell Carcinoma, well differentiated, left upper paraspinal back marked for biopsy with adjacent actinic keratosis Classification: Cancer can be considered a very large and exceptionally heterogeneous family of malignant diseases, with squamous cell carcinomas comprising one of the largest subsets.[10][11][12] All SCC lesions are thought to begin via the repeated, uncontrolled division of cancer stem cells of epithelial lineage or characteristics.[citation needed] SCCs arise from squamous cells, which are flat cells that line many areas of the body. Accumulation of these cancer cells causes a microscopic focus of abnormal cells that are, at least initially, locally confined within the specific tissue in which the progenitor cell resided. This condition is called squamous cell carcinoma in situ, and it is diagnosed when the tumor has not yet penetrated the basement membrane or other delimiting structure to invade adjacent tissues. Once the lesion has grown and progressed to the point where it has breached, penetrated, and infiltrated adjacent structures, it is referred to as invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Once a carcinoma becomes invasive, it is able to spread to other organs and cause the formation of a metastasis, or secondary tumor. SOURCE: WIKIPEDIA"

An angioma refers to any type of benign vascular tumor.[2] Some vascular tumors can be associated with serious blood-clotting disorders, making correct diagnosis critical.[3] A vascular tumor may be described in terms of being highly vascularized, or poorly vascularized, referring to the degree of blood supply to the tumor. Vascular tumors make up one of the classifications of vascular anomalies. The other grouping is vascular malformations. Vascular tumors can be further subclassified as being benign, borderline or aggressive, and malignant. Vascular tumors are described as proliferative, and vascular malformations as nonproliferative.[4] SOURCE: WIKIPEDIA"
